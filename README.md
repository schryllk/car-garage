# Car Garage Workshop
#### In this project I built a comprehensive car garage management system that is capable of accommodating three different vehicle types:
- Electric Vehicles (EVs)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) cars
- Regular (Gas/Diesel) cars

#### Basic functionality includes:
- View available vehicles in the garage
- Test Drive the Vehicle
- Sell The Vehicle
- Buy a Vehicle
- Store Vehicles in the garage
- Perform Maintance on Vehicle
